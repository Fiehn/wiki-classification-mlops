# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the

>
> Answer:

We did not use any linting for the project or anything for typing consistency. This would have been ideal but never entered out workflow. In a larger project this would have been vital. It is an important step for reproducability and readability espacially for larger projects where everyone has their own way of writing code. For example we can take the way to write functions and classes where you can easily distinguish between the two and gleen some function from them by the way they are written if consistent.

## Version control

>
> Answer:

For continuoues integration we have made 3 tests, which respectively tests the data structure, our model and the training of our model. The three tests are all included in the 'tests' folder. As the group members are using different operating systems and versions of python, we have set up the tests such that they run for both "ubuntu-latest" and "macos-latest", as well as two versions of python. This is reflected in the .github/workflows/tests.yaml file. 
To enforce good coding practices we have utilised ruff in our pre-commit.

> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:

**INSERT PICTURES** 
We have used W&B in our project for hyperparameter tuning using a sweep.yaml file as well as keeping track of key metrics of our model performance. First of all we are tracking the training accuracy, respectively over each epoch (train_acc_epoch) and during training at each step (train_acc_step). These statistics help us track how well the model is learning and help us diagnose potential issues like over- or underfitting. During the training we also measure the validation accuracy (val_acc), which provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. Lastly we track the 
test accuracy, which serves as the final evaluation metric for the model's ability to generalize to entirely unseen data.

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

For our project, we have developed two images, one for training and one for testing. These images are built on GCP, ensuring portability and scalability. A link to one of our Docker builds is provided below. We set up a Compute Engine instance for training our model, which is connected to our Dockerfile. This approach simplifies our workflow by avoiding the need to manually configure the environment on different machines. Instead, the container ensures consistency across deployments by packaging all dependencies, libraries, and code.

> *The starting point of the diagram is our local setup, where we integrated ... and ... and ... into our code.*
> *Whenever we commit code and push to GitHub, it auto triggers ... and ... . From there the diagram shows ...*
>
> Answer:

The diagram shows the overall setup for our project. It takes its starting point in the most right part of the diagram, with the three pytorch boxes (lightning, geometric and codebase). This part represents the actual development of code (data, model and train) using our third-party package. While building the project codebase, we utilized UV to manage dependencies. Using UV, all necessary Python packages were added to a requirements.txt file, ensuring that the project environment could be reproduced consistently across team members' systems and cloud environments. To further enhance reproducibility, we containerized the environment. Docker images were created for both training and testing workflows. These images encapsulate all dependencies, configurations, and the codebase, providing a consistent runtime environment irrespective of the underlying infrastructure.

**Version Control and Quality tests**
To enforce collaboration and code quality Git and GitHub were employed for version control. These tools allowed multiple team members to work in parallel on different features using branches and pull requests. GitHub also served as the central repository for the entire project. Pytest was implemented to test and validate the codebase. Automated tests ensured that new features or changes did not break existing functionality. For checking our code, we implemented some workflows using git and pytest. 

**Data**
Initially, the WikiCS dataset was downloaded locally. To improve data versioning and accessibility, we uploaded the dataset to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). From this point onward, all models and training workflows relied on the cloud-stored dataset, ensuring consistent and centralized access to the data. We also utilized DVC (Data Version Control) to manage dataset versions locally and track changes in a structured way.

Moving beyond local development, we integrated several cloud-based services to streamline training, deployment, and monitoring processes. As mentioned we used GCS to host the dataset and trained models. We moreover used Google Artifact Registry to store the Docker images created during development.These images were used for cloud-based training and running our sweeps for hyperparameter tuning. Finally we used vertex AI as the primary platform for training and deploying machine learning models. After training, the models were uploaded to Vertex AI for use in production.

During the project, setting up GCP and making everything work seamlessly in the cloud has by far taken up most of our time. We had a lot of issues with a docker images and training of our model working well locally, but not in the cloud. However once it we figured everything out with the right permission, service account and credentials, it worked very well and we therefore managed to do all of our training and hyperparameter tuning in the cloud.
